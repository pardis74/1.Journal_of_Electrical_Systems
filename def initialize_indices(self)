def initialize_indices(self):
    """
    Extract and assign the key indices (sets) from the input data dictionary.

    These indices represent the main domains over which the optimization
    problem is defined. They are used throughout the model to organize
    decision variables, compute objectives, and enforce constraints.

    Specifically:
    - activities: The set of manufacturing activities or tasks that need
      to be performed (denoted as index i in the model).
    - providers: The set of available service providers or resources that
      can execute activities (denoted as index j).
    - environment_indices: The set of environmental sustainability components
      or criteria (denoted as index e).
    - economic_indices: The set of economic sustainability components or
      criteria (denoted as index c).
    - social_indices: The set of social sustainability components or
      criteria (denoted as index s).

    After this method executes, these sets are accessible as attributes
    on the problem instance for further use in variable initialization,
    objective calculations, and constraints.
