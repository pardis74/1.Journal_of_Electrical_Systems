def __init__(self, data):
    """
    Initialize the CloudManufacturingProblem instance with input data.

    Parameters:
        data (dict): A dictionary containing all necessary input data required
                     to set up the problem, including:
                     - lists of activities, service providers, sustainability indices
                     - matrices or mappings for sustainability components (environmental, economic, social)
                     - constraints thresholds (time, cost, quality)
                     - logistics costs and other problem-specific parameters
    
    This initialization method performs four key setup steps:
    
    1. Store the raw input data for use throughout the problem.
    
    2. Extract and organize the key indices (sets) used in the problem such as:
       activities (i), service providers (j), and sustainability indices (e, c, s).
    
    3. Initialize the decision variables (such as assignment variables x_ij, auxiliary variables),
       as well as aggregate metrics like total execution time, cost, and quality.
    
    4. Define the objective functions and constraint functions as callable methods or attributes
       for use in the optimization process.
