    Constraint: Ensure that the environmental sustainability level meets a required minimum.

    This constraint enforces that for **each activity**, the total environmental sustainability
    score (based on the selected service provider) must be **at least** a predefined minimum
    threshold: `Enmin`.

    How it works:
    - For each activity `i`, sum the environmental component `EnCS[(i, j)]` for all providers `j`,
      but **only count those** where `x_ij[i][j] == 1`, meaning provider `j` is assigned to activity `i`.
    - This is essentially: EnCS[i] = ∑(j) EnCS[i, j] * x_ij[i, j]
    - Then check whether EnCS[i] ≥ Enmin.
    - This must hold for **every activity**.

    Returns:
        bool: True if all activities meet the environmental minimum; otherwise, False.
