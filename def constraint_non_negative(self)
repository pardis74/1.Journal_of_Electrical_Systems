def constraint_non_negative(self):
    """
    Constraint: Ensure that key output variables are non-negative.

    Description:
    This constraint ensures that the three critical outcome metrics—
    total execution time (`t_d`), total cost (`p_d`), and quality level (`q_d`)—
    remain non-negative. These values must be physically and logically valid
    within the problem domain.

    Purpose:
    - Prevents the model from producing infeasible or meaningless negative outputs.
    - Ensures compatibility with real-world interpretations (e.g., time and cost can't be negative).

    Logic:
    - `t_d` must be ≥ 0: Time cannot be negative.
    - `p_d` must be ≥ 0: Cost cannot be negative.
    - `q_d` must be ≥ 0: Quality must be defined positively or at worst, zero.

    Returns:
        bool: True if all three variables are non-negative; False otherwise.
