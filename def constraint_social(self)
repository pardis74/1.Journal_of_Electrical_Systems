def constraint_social(self):
    """
    Constraint: Ensure that the social sustainability level meets a required minimum.

    Description:
    This constraint verifies that for each activity `i`, the assigned provider offers
    a level of **social sustainability** (e.g., labor standards, worker safety, fair wages)
    that meets or exceeds a predefined threshold `Spmin`.

    Logic:
    - Iterate over all activities `i`.
    - For each activity, compute the weighted sum of social sustainability values
      `sCS[(i, j)]` multiplied by the decision variable `x_ij[i][j]` indicating assignment.
    - Since only one provider is assigned per activity, the sum effectively selects
      the social sustainability value for the chosen provider.
    - The sum for each activity must be â‰¥ `Spmin`.

    Returns:
        bool: True if all activity-provider assignments meet or exceed the social threshold;
              False otherwise.
