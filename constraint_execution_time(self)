def constraint_execution_time(self):
    """
    Constraint: Ensure that the total execution time does not exceed the allowable limit.

    Description:
    This constraint ensures that the overall execution time `t_d` for completing all
    service activities remains within a maximum threshold `Tmax` defined in the input data.

    Purpose:
    - Controls service delivery deadlines and customer time expectations.
    - Guarantees that the composite service plan adheres to time constraints.

    Logic:
    - `self.t_d` is assumed to have been computed elsewhere based on service durations,
      transfer times, and sequence structure (e.g., sequential, parallel, loop).
    - The constraint simply checks that `t_d` is â‰¤ `Tmax`.

    Returns:
        bool: True if execution time is within the allowed maximum; False otherwise.

    return self.t_d <= self.data['Tmax']
