    Initialize the objective functions for the optimization problem.

    In this multi-objective problem, there are three main objectives:
    
    1. OBJ1: Sustainability Objective
       - Minimize the combined sum of environmental, economic, and social
         sustainability components across all activity-provider assignments.
       
    2. OBJ2: Service Quality Objective
       - Maximize the quality of service by minimizing factors such as total
         execution time, total cost, and the inverse of the quality metric.
         Here, a composite quality measure is often taken as the maximum of
         execution time, cost, and 1/quality to handle multi-criteria in one metric.

    3. OBJ3: Logistics Cost Objective
       - Minimize the total logistics cost incurred by transferring between
         services and providers across activities.

    This method stores these objectives as callable functions in a dictionary
    so they can be easily accessed and evaluated during optimization.
