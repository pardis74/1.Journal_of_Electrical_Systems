def initialize_constraints(self):
    """
    Initialize the list of constraint functions for the optimization problem.

    Each constraint corresponds to a specific condition that the solution
    must satisfy to be considered feasible. These constraints enforce
    problem requirements such as minimum sustainability levels, resource
    limits, and logical correctness.

    The constraints are stored as callable methods in a list attribute,
    so the optimization algorithm can systematically check feasibility.

    Constraints included:

    1. constraint_environment:
       - Ensures that the environmental sustainability level meets or exceeds
         the minimum required threshold (Enmin).
    
    2. constraint_economy:
       - Ensures that the economic sustainability level meets or exceeds
         the minimum required threshold (Ecmin).

    3. constraint_social:
       - Ensures that the social sustainability level meets or exceeds
         the minimum required threshold (Spmin).

    4. constraint_execution_time:
       - Limits the total execution time (t_d) to be within the maximum
         allowable time (Tmax).

    5. constraint_total_cost:
       - Limits the total cost (p_d) to be within the maximum allowable cost (Pmax).

    6. constraint_quality_level:
       - Requires the overall service quality (q_d) to be at least the
         minimum acceptable quality (Qmin).

    7. constraint_one_provider_per_activity:
       - Enforces that each activity is assigned to exactly one service provider.
       - This means the sum of assignment variables x_ij across all j for
         each activity i must equal 1.

    8. constraint_linearization:
       - Enforces linearization conditions on auxiliary variables (z_ijirj)
         that are used to model interactions or logistics between assigned services.

    9. constraint_non_negative:
       - Ensures non-negativity of aggregate decision variables like execution
         time, cost, and quality metrics to maintain logical consistency.
