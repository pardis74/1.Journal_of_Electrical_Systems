def minimize_minimax_deviation(self):
    """
    Minimize the maximum weighted deviation among multiple objectives.

    Description:
    This method implements the **minimax goal programming** approach, which
    focuses on minimizing the worst (maximum) weighted deviation from all objectives.
    Instead of summing deviations, it looks for a solution that balances objectives by
    reducing the largest individual deviation, promoting a more balanced trade-off.

    Returns:
        float: The maximum weighted deviation across all objectives.
