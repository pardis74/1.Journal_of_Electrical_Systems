def constraint_quality_level(self):
    """
    Constraint: Ensure that the service quality level meets or exceeds a minimum threshold.

    Description:
    This constraint verifies that the overall service quality metric `q_d` is
    greater than or equal to a required minimum `Qmin`. This ensures that the
    composed services meet basic quality standards.

    Purpose:
    - Protects service users from low-quality outcomes.
    - Encourages the selection of higher-quality service providers.

    Logic:
    - `q_d` represents the aggregated quality score of the selected service composition.
    - `Qmin` is the minimum required quality level defined in the input data.
    - The constraint ensures that `q_d` â‰¥ `Qmin`.

    Returns:
        bool: True if quality is acceptable; False if it's below the minimum threshold.
