def constraint_linearization(self):
    """
    Constraint: Enforce linearization for pairwise interaction terms used in logistics cost.

    Description:
    This placeholder method represents a constraint that ensures proper linearization
    of product terms between binary decision variables. These arise when modeling
    pairwise relationships between activities and service providers (e.g., for transfer cost).

    In this simplified implementation, we return True, assuming these constraints have
    already been handled elsewhere (e.g., in pre-processing, or encoded in the MILP solver).

    Purpose:
    - Prevent non-linear terms from violating linear programming formulation.
    - Maintain solvability using MILP or LP solvers by transforming `x_ij * x_i'j'` terms
      into auxiliary binary variables (e.g., `z_ijirj`), with additional constraints.

    Typical Linearization Constraints:
    For all relevant pairs (i, j, i', j'):
        z_ijirj ≤ (x_ij + x_i'j') / 2  
        z_ijirj ≥ x_ij + x_i'j' - 1  
        z_ijirj ∈ {0, 1}

    These ensure:
    - z_ijirj = 1 if and only if both x_ij and x_i'j' are 1.
    - Otherwise, z_ijirj = 0.

    Returns:
        bool: Always returns True here, as a placeholder.
    """
    return True  # In real implementation, enforce linearization constraints on z_ijirj variables
