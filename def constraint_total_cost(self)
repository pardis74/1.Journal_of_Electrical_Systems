def constraint_total_cost(self):
    """
    Constraint: Ensure that the total cost of executing the service composition does not exceed the allowable budget.

    Description:
    This constraint ensures that the overall cost `p_d` for executing all assigned
    activities (including service fees and potentially transfer/logistics costs)
    does not exceed a predefined maximum budget `Pmax`.

    Purpose:
    - Keeps the solution financially feasible.
    - Helps enforce a customer's or organization's cost limitations.

    Logic:
    - `self.p_d` is the total calculated cost of the selected service composition.
      It is assumed to be updated elsewhere during evaluation.
    - The constraint checks if this cost is within the allowed budget (`Pmax`).

    Returns:
        bool: True if the total cost is within budget; False if it exceeds the limit.
